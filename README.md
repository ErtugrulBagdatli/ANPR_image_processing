# ANPR_image_processing
A basic number plate recognition with only using digital image processing filters and methods.

After applying some filters, we find the contour of the car's number plate. Then we apply similar filters to this cropped number plate and give it to the easyOCR.
With my colleague we made a user interface for ease of use.

Some steps can be seen in the below figure.
